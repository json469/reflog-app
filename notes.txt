Designing the app wasn't all that easy due to the lack of existing app that really captures 
the whole<italic> solution. I started off by reviewing each components: Bible (Bible App), Prayer (Echo Prayer App).

I was easily overwehelmed (as usual) by looking in detail too closely of each (advance) functions. Therefore, I humbled(?) myself and took a step back and made a goal to get the bare minimum functions added and added well!
